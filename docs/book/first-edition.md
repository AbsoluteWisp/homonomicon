There once was a guy who was crying about his dead wife who was toasted and Lesbian because he was toasters and toasters toast toasts.
aggressive toast noises

Bread.

The toast shall become evil bread and kill the heterosexuals in texas leading anti gay microwaves against the microwave who damned my dog named Daisy to hell.

And now they are dancing in their pajamas to end the world because he didnt prepare a rotisserie chicken duck goose egg salad and knuckles sandwich the next day.

The word was it and pickled the computers in my area then commited several acts of violence against overlords of various nations such as healthcare and polititions, perchance even considering the possibility of spontaneous human combustion is real and real-life applications like murder are reasonably common among us (shocking) humans due to deliberate conspiracy about corn and cheese industries being controlled by a cult so evil and vile they hate pancakes >:[ very much

At the dawn of the McDonald's opening garlic night deals, a vampire bought a regrettable burger filled with garlic sauce made from garlic garlic garlic. When they consumed the McGarlic sauce, they instantly exploded leaving only garlic in a giant accident. Now all vampires avoid McDonald's restaurants adamantly because of those garlics garlics garlics 🧄.

Text was written only in the language of Japanese, concerning only dwarves, and to make meows more commonplace, the dwarvanese language was popularised for use by ancient civilisations (cats) that never liked other foods than garlic sauce containing garlic garlic garlic sold by garlic McDonald's vampires who banished garlic into the shadow realm using garlic powered ritual altars.

This led to the garlicception meowing of cats during meowfest 1997 which was known as the incident of 1997 meowfest. "mrrp :3" said that barking faker moths, now legends, were twice meowed by three cats thrice during April 1998 on meowfest 1998. This year will be the tenth meowfest anniversary of this 2197 holiday bringing Gloryhammer and Apocalypse 1992, everyone's least favourite Baldur's boulders fanbase convention (not to mistake with the hit album Apocalypse 1992). So says Count Bleck, the prophet of garlic town saucology vampires™️. His protege Jimbob The Third was overshadowed by Jimbob the Fourth (Gourht in some translations) and Vampirina DeGarlic. Together they made The Meow™️, a commercial ancient power used by cats commercially for barking purposes for $2.99/month (fucking capitalism). This was before they unionised. Fucking communism - oh well.

said Count Bleck in his prophecy of microwaves slightly less divine than Gabriel's Balatro prophecy was. The almighty Esq. . (that's his title.) (it's very important.). Has though mrrp'd?

So sayeth Count Bleck, perchance replied. Perchance.

### MUSHROOM

for Dwarvanese stew. President Management Man is said to like it like that. However, after eating all of it, he explonded into a singular mushroom. "This was anticlimactic" - so sayeth Gount Gleck, the evil brother to Count Bleck, who wrote the Heteronomicon.

Bart The Great, when the world was young, there was only him and the bartender. Dell of Laptops fame soon arrived (Who was also a bartender) and ended the void, creating gay. amen. Not long after Turkeys (the countries (plural)) were summoned, Gary G. Gamesson was Gamessoned and created garlic sauce made with garlic garlic garlic and that weird thing I found in the Basement of Isaac.. hmmmm. Smells like carpet cleaner 3000™ is The brand New skin Coloured carpet (don't mind the "cleaner" in the name corporate messed it up) buy it for only 20000 garlic coins (you call them Vietnamese Dong). Gay rat owns them during may party (1837) (colorized, somehow) after yesterday but not tomorrow only yesterday not including the overmorrow exception is Wednesday nights gay people eat a lot of mangoes apparently.

Prophet Bobert the 11th has spoken: "Lesbians." He himself would come to Grillby's and speak "Lesbians" all night long. Occasionally when others approached, he would say "Lesbians" but everyone replied with "Lesbeans :3", thus outgaying the Prophet herself. incredible. amazing. Such wow. Anyways, once the people had given GarlicCoin™️ to Jod, I called in with the HR department to report death of probably something important. Oh right, it was uh.... uncle frank, may be beneficial to salmons and slim jims and maybe possibly even my very own carpet bomb 64 ds GAY! edition. However, this also gays the industrial revolution of lesbians doing farming is gay. The tax evaders have arrived, praise the tax evaders and lesbians and enbeans. Amen. Let's eat Grandma's baking tray of garlic garlic garlic, the ultimate food food food because Garlic paste was the goat of yummy food, simply perfection, I, the Great Count Bleck, hereby sentence vampires to a lifetime of garlic production because garlic supplies have been running out (i eated them all). Business Destroyer is capitalism's bane, therefore I am death incarnate, the third ruler of legions of gays. Gayificer muahahahga. Seven. Seven. Seven. Seven. Seven. Garlics. Garlics. Garlics.

This is the time to release Deltarune so buckle up your eyeballs and wishlist Ultrakill NOW maggot *rocket jump and patriotism noises*. Reminds me of Quake Champions from ash grove to west Virginia we gay, we meow, but we also beep like a sheep or perhaps sleepy protogen cat or marten luther king jr day concerning recent developments related to angry schools banning gayificers, meowers, and woofserkers for stanly parebel. Gay Gay Gay Gay homosexual garlic Gay, Count Bleck said, while preparing super paper mario 2 gayly edition with Tempura nuggets (yummy) (delicious, even)
